Hi, I am a PhD student, supervised by Amos Storkey, in the school of Informatics at Edinburgh University. I am primarily interested in machine learning and currently focus on designing and analysing systems which learn to perform tasks given an online stream of data. Prior to the PhD I completed a master's and bachelors in Computer Science at the University of Cambridge.
